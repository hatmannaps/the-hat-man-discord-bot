# the-hat-man-discord-bot
A Discord bot very similar to Gen.AI but it's more dumb.

# How does it work?

This discord bot is basically just Gen.AI except I made it with some features I'd like for my Discord server which are;
It's memory, it remembers words just like Gen.AI and uses them to formulate sentances
Is it filtered? No because I don't want to stop you from doing whatever you want with this, it has no lisencing after all..
It can also pull out a ton of words from a file known as german_words.json (this is replacablee to any language you want i'll explain it later)
It does not use any sort of machine learning it jsut saves stuff and thats it.

# How to set it up?
You need to make a bot in Discord Developer Page (to get your token) be free to customize it however you want
And this is coded in Node.js v16.0.0 or higher whatever you see fit.
Installing all the dependencies you have to download these:
-discord.js
-google-translate-api-x
You'll figure it out.

# What are the bot commands?
-!help: Displays a help message with a list of commands.
-!viewfiles: Shows the sizes of important files like learned_words.json and messageHistory.json.
-!randomword german: Gives a random German word and its English translation.
-!stats: Displays the bot's stats, such as the most used word by the user and their online/offline status.
-!stats @username: Displays the stats of the mentioned user (most used word and online/offline status).

# How do we replace the German Words?
Download somewhere on the internet a list of words from whatever language you want and replace the file and all the things mentioning it in the code.

# What can you do and what can't you do with the bot?
   - You can modify the bot; but i'd like some credit for making it (this is up to you it doesn't really matter)
   - You cant add malware or garbage to it and paint me in a bad light :)
   - You can add your own commands
